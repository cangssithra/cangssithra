## 💭 Development Philosophy

> *"Debugging is like playing Magic: The Gathering - you think you understand the rules until someone plays a weird combo"* 🎮

My stack priorities:
- ✅ Readable code > Clever code (I'm not that smart, neither are you)
- ✅ Modular architecture (like building a good MTG deck)
- ✅ Handle edge cases (because users ALWAYS tap mana wrong)
- 🐛 If it compiles, ship it! (JK... mostly)
